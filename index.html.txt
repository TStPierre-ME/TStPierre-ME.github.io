        <h3>How broad is the Clean Energy sector?</h3>
        <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>My role supports employers and jobseekers in the Clean Energy economy, and many people wonder just how broad Clean Energy is in Maine. It’s bigger than you might think. It includes any company that helps support clean energy in some way.</p>
        <p>Direct work includes building or working with solar power, wind energy, hydropower, electric vehicles, and more.</p>
        <p>Support work includes companies that help build or improve clean energy systems or green buildings. This could be construction, plumbing, heating, or other skilled jobs.</p>
        <p>It also includes businesses that focus on green or eco-friendly work—like those reducing waste or saving energy. These companies also need workers in everyday roles like sales, marketing, IT, admin, and leadership.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p><strong>What is it?</strong><br>
        An apprenticeship is a way to train workers for your business. The Maine Apprenticeship Program (MAP) helps you design training, create learning materials, and take care of paperwork.</p>
        <p>MAP supports many industries: healthcare, construction, manufacturing, clean energy, education, hospitality, IT, and more.</p>
        <p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><br>
        Apprentices usually stay with a company longer—90% of them stick around! That’s because they feel more connected and supported.</p>
        <p><strong>When should I start?</strong><br>
        You can start anytime. It’s best to begin during slower times of the year. It usually takes about 30 days to set up the program and be ready to recruit.</p>
        <p><strong>Cost?</strong> It’s free! Offered by the Maine Department of Labor.</p>
